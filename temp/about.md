I am a Graduate Research Assistant and a Ph.D. student, working with <a href='https://fawadahm.github.io/'> Dr. Fawad Ahmad</a> in the Networked Sensing Systems Lab, <a href='https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-computer-science'> Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href='https://www.rit.edu/'> Rochester Institute of Technology</a>, New York, USA. 

My research focuses on networked sensing, particularly in autonomous driving. I aim to improve the perception capabilities of autonomous vehicles by leveraging vehicle-to-vehicle and roadside unit-to-vehicle cooperation. This involves the real-time sharing and precise fusion of raw 3D data. Additionally, I work on 3D reconstruction, mapping, and tracking using neural radiance field (NeRF) technology.
