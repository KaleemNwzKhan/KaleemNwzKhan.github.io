I am pursuing my Ph.D. as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Computer Science at Golisano College of Computing and Information Sciences at Rochester Institute of Technology, New York, USA. 

My research focuses on networked sensing, particularly in autonomous driving. I aim to improve the perception capabilities of autonomous vehicles by leveraging vehicle-to-vehicle and roadside unit-to-vehicle cooperation. This involves the real-time sharing and precise fusion of raw 3D data. Additionally, I work on 3D reconstruction, mapping, and tracking using neural radiance field (NeRF) technology.
