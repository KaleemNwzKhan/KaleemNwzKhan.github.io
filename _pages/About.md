I am a Ph.D. student, working with <a href='https://fawadahm.github.io/'> Dr. Fawad Ahmad</a> in the Networked Sensing Systems Lab, 
<a href='https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-computer-science'> Department of Computer Science</a> at 
<a href='https://www.rit.edu/'> Rochester Institute of Technology</a>, New York, USA.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Research Theme:</strong> Towards Scalable and Accurate Perception for Autonomous Systems.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Research Focus:</strong> My research centers on advancing cooperative perception in autonomous systems, with a focus on autonomous vehicles (AVs). I aim to develop accurate and scalable infrastructure-assisted and vehicle-to-vehicle cooperative perception frameworks that operate within real-time constraints. Additionally, I explore neural rendering methods, such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, for 3D traffic scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. With this, I aim to enhance AVs' perception capabilities beyond traditional approaches.

<p>
<strong>Academic Background:</strong> I graduated with honors from the 
<a href='https://www.nu.edu.pk/'> National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (NUCES)</a>, Pakistan, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in 2015 
and Master's degree in Computer Science in 2018. From 2019 to 2021, I led a research team (AI in Healthcare) at the Intelligent Information Processing Lab 
within the <a href='https://ncai.pk/'>National Center for Artificial Intelligence (NCAI)</a> in Peshawar, Pakistan.
