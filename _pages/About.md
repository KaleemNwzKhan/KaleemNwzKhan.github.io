I am a Ph.D. student, working with <a href='https://fawadahm.github.io/'> Dr. Fawad Ahmad</a> in the Networked Sensing Systems Lab, 
<a href='https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-computer-science'> Department of Computer Science</a> at 
<a href='https://www.rit.edu/'> Rochester Institute of Technology</a>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Academic Background:</strong> I graduated with honors from the 
<a href='https://www.nu.edu.pk/'>National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (NUCES)</a> in Pakistan, completing my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science in 2015 and 2018, respectively. From 2019 to 2021, I served as a research team lead at the Intelligent Information Processing Lab, part of the <a href='https://ncai.pk/'>National Center for Artificial Intelligence (NCAI)</a> in Peshawar. I also held lecturer positions at <a href='https://bahria.edu.pk/'>Bahria University Islamabad</a> and the <a href='https://www.uetmardan.edu.pk/uetm/'>University of Engineering and Technology, Mardan</a>. 
</p>

<p>
<strong>Research Focus:</strong> My research centers on advancing cooperative perception in autonomous systems, with a focus on autonomous vehicles (AVs). I aim to develop accurate and scalable infrastructure-assisted and vehicle-to-vehicle cooperative perception frameworks that operate within real-time constraints. Additionally, I explore neural rendering methods, such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, for 3D traffic scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. With this, I aim to enhance AVs' perception capabilities beyond traditional approaches.
